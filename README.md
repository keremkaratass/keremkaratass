## 🧠 Engineering Perspective

I build backend systems with a strong focus on:

- Clean Code, SOLID Principles & Design Patterns
- System Design & Scalable Architectures
- Distributed Systems & Data Consistency
- Transaction-heavy system reliability
- Understanding business rules before implementation

I believe good engineering sits at the intersection of **software craftsmanship, system thinking and business domain awareness**.
